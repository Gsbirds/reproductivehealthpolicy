# reproductivehealthpolicy

I used React and Django to make a website that allows people to find out the abortion policies and insurance policies regarding abortion so they can
be easily informed. I used an API from Abortion Policy API in order to get this information. 
I am also attempting to utilize chatGPT in order to provide people with suggestions on organizations that could help them obtain care.
My belief is that everyone should have equal, easily available and understandable information about their own healthcare options. I used web sockets to add a chat feature as well.

Technologies used include:
Javascript, Python, Html, CSS
